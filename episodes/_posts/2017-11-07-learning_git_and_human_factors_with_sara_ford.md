Martin and Edward talk to Sara Ford about getting started using Git
with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, using Git on Windows, and
best practices getting set up on the command line.  They wade into a
discussion of `git merge --squash` versus `git rebase --interactive`,
and Sara explains human factors in software development and prescriptive
and descriptive software design.

And a bonus Git commentary: Ed explains why you need that crazy double-dash
when you want to check out a single file.
